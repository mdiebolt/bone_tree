  :coderay
    #!ruby
      # get a new filetree
      tree = new BoneTree.Views.Tree

      # add a new file to the directory
      tree.add('source/main.js', {file: true})

      # this creates the directory source if it doesn't already exist and puts the file main.js inside of it

      tree.bind 'rename', (model, newName) =>
        # this callback is passed the model that changed and the new name of the node
        console.log model

      tree.bind 'remove', (model, collection) =>
        # this callback is passed the model that was removed and the collection it was removed from
        console.log model

      tree.bind 'openFile', (file) =>
        # this callback is passed the file that was just clicked on
        console.log file

:coffeescript
  window.tree = new BoneTree.Views.Tree
